# Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islan
# ds. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands
# horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all su
# rrounded by water.

#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input:
# 11110
# 11010
# 11000
# 00000
